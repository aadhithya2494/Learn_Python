# 1. Define a function that accepts an integer n.
# 2. For every positive integer i â‰¤ n, apply the following rules:
# o Print "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by both 3 and 5.
# o Print "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3 (but not 5).
# o Print "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5 (but not 3).
# o Print the number itself (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
# 3. Call the function with user input as the argument.
